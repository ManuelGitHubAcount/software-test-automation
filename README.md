# Automatic Functional Tests ->Focus Services 
_The focusservices program implements an application that runs functional tests automatically,
Navigating through the different components of the web page, allows you to view each component found
and the action executed in it, additionally the program validates internally if the component was located successfully, 
if it exists or does not exist. For any 'success' or 'failure' result, the program prints the results for each test case
to the console_
